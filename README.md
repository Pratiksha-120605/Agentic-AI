# 🤖 Agentic AI

An implementation-focused repository exploring **Agentic AI systems** that can reason, plan, use tools, and perform multi-step task execution autonomously.

---

## 📌 Overview

Agentic AI goes beyond simple text generation.  
It enables AI systems to:

- 🧠 Think step-by-step  
- 🛠 Use external tools  
- 🔁 Execute tool loops  
- 📡 Call APIs  
- 💾 Maintain memory  
- 📊 Perform multi-step reasoning  

This repository contains hands-on experiments and implementations using modern LLM frameworks.

## 🧠 What is Agentic AI?

Agentic AI combines:

- Large Language Models (LLMs)
- Tool execution
- Reasoning loops (ReAct pattern)
- Memory systems
- Decision-making logic

Unlike traditional chatbots, agentic systems can **analyze → decide → act → observe → respond**.
