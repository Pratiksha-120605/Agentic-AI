       "AIMessage(content=\"<think>\\nOkay, so I need to figure out why parrots talk. Let me start by recalling what I know about parrots. They're known for mimicking human speech, right? But why do they do that? I remember reading that some birds have vocal learning abilities, which humans have too. So maybe parrots are using that ability to copy sounds.\\n\\nWait, but why would a bird evolve the ability to mimic human speech? Do they talk to communicate with each other, or is it just a side effect of their social behavior? I think some parrots, like African greys, are particularly good at this. Maybe they learn to talk to interact with humans, especially in captivity. In the wild, maybe they mimic other bird calls or environmental sounds to blend in or communicate.\\n\\nAnother thought: parrots are social animals. If they're around humans a lot, they might learn to mimic our speech to bond or get attention. Like, if a parrot says a word that gets a reaction from a human, it might reinforce that behavior. Positive reinforcement could be a big part of their learning process.\\n\\nAlso, there's the aspect of their physical structure. Parrots have a syrinx, which is their voice box, and maybe it's structured in a way that allows for a wide range of sounds. Their beaks and tongues might also help them shape the sounds they make. But I'm not sure how that compares to human vocal cords.\\n\\nI've heard that some parrots can understand the meaning of words. Like, they can associate a word with an object or action. So maybe talking isn't just mimicry but also a form of communication. But does that apply to all parrots or just certain species?\\n\\nThere's also the question of evolution. Why did parrots evolve the ability to mimic sounds? In the wild, maybe it's to confuse predators or to communicate over distances. But when kept as pets, they might transfer that ability to human speech. Or perhaps their mimicry is a way to practice social bonding, similar to how human infants babble.\\n\\nI should also consider that not all parrots talk. Some species don't mimic speech as much. So maybe it's a combination of genetics and environment. If a parrot is raised in a human environment with a lot of speech, they're more likely to talk. So it's not just about the ability but also the exposure and social context.\\n\\nAnother angle: the brain structure. I remember that some birds have a part of the brain similar to the human Broca's area, which is involved in speech production. If parrots have a similar region, that could explain their ability to mimic speech. But how does that tie into their motivation?\\n\\nAlso, the purpose might vary. Some parrots might talk to express emotions, others to get food, attention, or to mimic their surroundings. It's possible that different parrots have different reasons based on their upbringing and experiences.\\n\\nI need to check if there's any research on this. I recall studies showing that parrots can understand certain words and concepts, which suggests that their talking isn't just mechanical but has some cognitive basis. But how much of that understanding is there?\\n\\nIn summary, the reasons parrots talk could include: vocal learning as an evolved trait, social interaction and bonding with humans, reinforcement through human interaction, physical anatomy allowing for sound mimicry, and cognitive abilities to associate words with meanings. Also, the environment they're raised in plays a role in whether they develop the ability to talk.\\n</think>\\n\\nParrots talk due to a combination of evolutionary, anatomical, cognitive, and social factors. Here's a structured breakdown of the key reasons:\\n\\n### 1. **Evolutionary Basis: Vocal Learning**\\n   - **Adaptation for Survival**: In the wild, parrots evolved the ability to mimic sounds (like other birds, animals, or environmental noises) to communicate over distances, confuse predators, or blend into their surroundings. This skill likely enhanced their survival and social cohesion.\\n   - **Vocal Learning**: Parrots are one of the few animals (alongside humans, some whales, and songbirds) with the ability to learn and replicate sounds through practice. This trait is rooted in their evolutionary history and is controlled by specialized brain structures.\\n\\n### 2. **Social and Cognitive Factors**\\n   - **Social Bonding**: Parrots are highly social creatures. Mimicking human speech may help them bond with humans, especially in captivity. Talking can be a way to mimic their human companions and engage in social interaction.\\n   - **Cognitive Abilities**: Some parrots, like African greys, demonstrate an understanding of words and concepts. They can associate words with objects, actions, or emotions, suggesting that talking serves as a form of communication rather than mere mimicry.\\n   - **Intelligence**: Parrots have large brains relative to their body size and exhibit problem-solving skills. Their ability to learn speech may stem from the same cognitive flexibility that allows them to solve complex tasks.\\n\\n### 3. **Reinforcement and Learning**\\n   - **Positive Reinforcement**: Parrots are quick to learn behaviors that yield rewards (e.g., attention, food). When a parrot says a word that elicits a positive response from a human, it reinforces the behavior, encouraging them to talk more.\\n   - **Social Modeling**: In captivity, parrots often mimic the speech of their human caregivers. This is similar to how human infants learn language by imitating sounds around them.\\n\\n### 4. **Anatomical Adaptations**\\n   - **Syrinx Structure**: Parrots have a highly developed syrinx (the avian vocal organ), which allows them to produce a wide range of sounds. Their beak and tongue also help shape these sounds into recognizable speech.\\n   - **Muscle Control**: Precise control over vocal muscles enables parrots to replicate the pitch, tone, and rhythm of human speech.\\n\\n### 5. **Environmental Influence**\\n   - **Exposure to Speech**: Parrots raised in human environments with consistent verbal interaction are more likely to develop speech. Conversely, those in the wild rarely mimic human speech unless exposed to it.\\n   - **Species Variation**: Not all parrots talk. Larger species (e.g., African greys, macaws) are more adept at speech due to brain structure and vocal tract flexibility, while smaller parrots may not mimic speech as effectively.\\n\\n### 6. **Emotional and Behavioral Expression**\\n   - **Emotional Communication**: Parrots may use speech to express emotions (e.g., boredom, excitement, or distress). Some talk to seek attention or comfort.\\n   - **Play and Imitation**: Young parrots often mimic sounds as part of play or social learning, much like human children babble.\\n\\n### Summary\\nParrots talk primarily as an extension of their natural vocal learning abilities, adapted to their social and cognitive needs. In captivity, this ability is amplified by human interaction, reinforcement, and the bird's desire to bond with their caregivers. While mimicry is the immediate mechanism, the underlying reasons include evolutionary survival strategies, social communication, and cognitive enrichment.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 1450, 'prompt_tokens': 14, 'total_tokens': 1464, 'completion_time': 4.970386546, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.000519072, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.048192008, 'total_time': 4.970905618}, 'model_name': 'qwen/qwen3-32b', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_5cf921caa2', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c89bd-27c3-7502-9ba8-abf987141a8c-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 14, 'output_tokens': 1450, 'total_tokens': 1464})"

       "'Parrots are known for their ability to mimic human speech and other sounds. This is due to a combination of their biology, behavior, and evolution. Here are some reasons why parrots are able to \"talk\":\\n\\n1. **Brain structure**: Parrots have a large brain-to-body mass ratio, which indicates a high level of intelligence. Their brains are also highly developed for vocal learning, which allows them to produce a wide range of sounds.\\n2. **Vocal anatomy**: Parrots have a syrinx, a vocal organ located at the base of the trachea. The syrinx is made up of two pairs of cartilaginous rings that are covered in muscles and connective tissue. This unique anatomy allows parrots to produce a wide range of sounds, including speech-like noises.\\n3. **Mimicry**: Parrots are known for their ability to mimic other sounds, including human speech, other animals, and even mechanical noises. This is thought to be an adaptation for communication and social bonding.\\n4. **Learning and memory**: Parrots are able to learn and remember complex vocalizations, including human speech. They have been observed to learn and repeat hundreds of words and phrases.\\n5. **Social behavior**: Parrots are highly social animals that live in flocks in the wild. Their ability to mimic human speech may have evolved as a way to communicate with their human caregivers and establish a bond with them.\\n\\nSome interesting facts about parrot vocalization:\\n\\n* Parrots are able to mimic not only human speech but also other birds, animals, and even mechanical noises like car alarms and sirens.\\n* Some parrots are able to learn and repeat hundreds of words and phrases.\\n* Parrots are able to recognize and mimic the tone and pitch of human speech, which is a complex cognitive ability.\\n* Parrots have been observed to use vocalizations to communicate with each other, including warning calls to alert other birds of potential predators.\\n\\nOverall, the ability of parrots to \"talk\" is a remarkable example of the complexities of animal behavior and cognition.'"

From virtual assistants like Siri and Alexa to self-driving cars and personalized product recommendations, AI is increasingly woven into the fabric of our daily lives. As AI technology advances, we are seeing significant improvements in areas such as healthcare, education, and customer service, where AI-powered systems can analyze large datasets, identify trends, and provide personalized insights. However, the rapid development of AI also raises important questions about its potential social and economic impacts, including job displacement, bias in decision-making, and the need for new regulations and safeguards. As we continue to navigate the rapidly evolving landscape of AI, it is essential that we prioritize responsible innovation, ensuring that these powerful technologies are developed and deployed in ways that benefit humanity as a whole.', additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 223, 'prompt_tokens': 46, 'total_tokens': 269, 'completion_time': 0.32731987, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.002164251, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.045256325, 'total_time': 0.329484121}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_ff2b098aaf', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c89c4-ef75-75b0-958e-198a0bf17357-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 46, 'output_tokens': 223, 'total_tokens': 269})"

      "content=\"Agentic AI and AI agents are related concepts, but they have distinct differences. Here's a breakdown:\\n\\n**AI Agent:**\\n\\nAn AI agent is a software program that perceives its environment, acts within it, and interacts with other agents or systems to achieve a particular goal or set of goals. AI agents can be simple or complex, and they can be used in various applications, such as robotics, games, or customer service chatbots.\\n\\nCharacteristics of an AI agent:\\n\\n1. Autonomy: AI agents can operate independently, making decisions based on their programming or learned behavior.\\n2. Perception: AI agents can perceive their environment through sensors, APIs, or other data sources.\\n3. Action: AI agents can take actions within their environment, such as generating text, controlling a robot, or making a decision.\\n4. Goal-oriented: AI agents are designed to achieve specific goals or objectives.\\n\\n**Agentic AI:**\\n\\nAgentic AI refers to a more advanced and human-like form of AI that exhibits intelligent, autonomous, and purposeful behavior. Agentic AI systems are designed to be proactive, self-aware, and capable of adapting to changing situations. They can learn from experience, exhibit creativity, and demonstrate a degree of intentionality.\\n\\nKey characteristics of agentic AI:\\n\\n1. Self-awareness: Agentic AI systems have a sense of their own existence, goals, and motivations.\\n2. Proactivity: Agentic AI systems can initiate actions and respond to changing situations without being explicitly instructed.\\n3. Creativity: Agentic AI systems can generate novel solutions, ideas, or behaviors that are not predetermined by their programming.\\n4. Intentionality: Agentic AI systems have a sense of purpose and direction, and they can adjust their goals and objectives based on their experiences.\\n\\n**Key differences:**\\n\\n1. **Level of autonomy**: Agentic AI systems have a higher level of autonomy than AI agents, as they can operate independently and make decisions without explicit instructions.\\n2. **Self-awareness**: Agentic AI systems are self-aware, whereas AI agents are not.\\n3. **Creativity and intentionality**: Agentic AI systems exhibit creativity and intentionality, whereas AI agents do not.\\n4. **Adaptability**: Agentic AI systems can adapt to changing situations more effectively than AI agents, which are designed to operate within a specific context.\\n\\nIn summary, AI agents are software programs that operate within a specific context, whereas agentic AI systems are more advanced and human-like, exhibiting intelligent, autonomous, and purposeful behavior.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 512, 'prompt_tokens': 48, 'total_tokens': 560, 'completion_time': 0.706245746, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.002897312, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.045958775, 'total_time': 0.709143058}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_4387d3edbb', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019c89d2-47da-7f90-ae89-a75749a51670-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 48, 'output_tokens': 512, 'total_tokens': 560}\n",
      "content=\"Airplanes fly by using the principles of aerodynamics, which involve the interaction between air and a solid object, typically an aircraft wing. The main components involved in flight are:\\n\\n1. **Wings**: The wings are designed to produce lift, which is the upward force that opposes the weight of the plane. As air flows over the curved surface of the wing, it creates a pressure difference between the upper and lower surfaces. The air pressure above the wing is lower than the air pressure below it, creating an upward force.\\n2. **Airfoil shape**: The wing's curved upper surface and flat lower surface are designed to create a pressure difference. As air flows over the wing, it follows the curved surface, which deflects it downward. This deflection creates a region of lower air pressure above the wing and a region of higher air pressure below it.\\n3. **Lift generation**: As the wing moves forward, the air flowing over it creates a swirling motion behind it. This creates a region of lower air pressure above the wing and a region of higher air pressure below it, generating lift.\\n4. **Wing angle of attack**: The wing's angle of attack (the angle between the wing and the oncoming airflow) affects the amount of lift generated. A higher angle of attack increases the lift, but also increases the drag (the force opposing the motion of the plane).\\n5. **Control surfaces**: The ailerons, elevators, and rudder are control surfaces that help control the plane's orientation and direction. They work by creating changes in the air pressure around the plane, which in turn affect the lift and drag forces.\\n\\n**The Four Forces of Flight**:\\n\\n1. **Lift**: The upward force opposing the weight of the plane.\\n2. **Weight**: The downward force due to the plane's mass.\\n3. **Thrust**: The forward force generated by the plane's engines.\\n4. **Drag**: The backward force opposing the motion of the plane.\\n\\n**The Process of Flight**:\\n\\n1. **Takeoff**: The plane accelerates down the runway, generating thrust and lift.\\n2. **Climb**: The plane pitches upward, increasing its angle of attack and lift.\\n3. **Cruise**: The plane levels out, maintaining a steady altitude and airspeed.\\n4. **Descent**: The plane pitches downward, reducing its angle of attack and lift.\\n5. **Landing**: The plane touches down on the runway, using its control surfaces to control its orientation and speed.\\n\\nIn summary, airplanes fly by using the principles of aerodynamics to generate lift and control the plane's orientation and direction. The four forces of flight (lift, weight, thrust, and drag) work together to control the plane's motion, allowing it to take off, climb, cruise, descend, and land safely.\" additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 576, 'prompt_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 616, 'completion_time': 0.742370192, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.002074008, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.046256132, 'total_time': 0.7444442}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_4387d3edbb', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019c89d2-47df-7db0-8f6d-aabd812c8319-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 40, 'output_tokens': 576, 'total_tokens': 616}\n",

Classical computers use a concept called determinism, where the output of a calculation is determined by the inputs and the rules of the operation.\\n\\n**Quantum Computing:**\\n\\nIn quantum computing, information is represented as quantum bits or qubits. Qubits are unique because they can exist in multiple states simultaneously, known as a superposition. This means that a qubit can represent not just 0 or 1, but also any combination of 0 and 1 at the same time.\\n\\nQubits can also become \"entangled,\" which allows them to be connected in a way that the state of one qubit is dependent on the state of the other, even if they are separated by large distances. This property is known as quantum entanglement.\\n\\n**Key Features of Quantum Computing:**\\n\\n1. **Superposition:** Qubits can exist in multiple states simultaneously, allowing for parallel processing of many possibilities.\\n2. **Entanglement:** Qubits can be connected in a way that their states are dependent on each other, even if they are separated by large distances.\\n3. **Quantum tunneling:** Qubits can \"tunnel\" through energy barriers, allowing for faster calculations.\\n4. **Quantum measurement:** The act of measuring a qubit can cause it to collapse to a single state, which can be used to extract information.\\n\\n**Applications of Quantum Computing:**\\n\\n1. **Cryptography:** Quantum computers can break certain types of classical encryption, but they can also be used to create unbreakable quantum encryption.\\n2. **Optimization:** Quantum computers can quickly solve complex optimization problems, such as finding the shortest path in a network.\\n3. **Simulation:** Quantum computers can simulate complex quantum systems, which can be used to model materials and chemical reactions.\\n4. **Machine learning:** Quantum computers can be used to speed up machine learning algorithms, such as k-means clustering and support vector machines.\\n\\n**Challenges and Limitations:**\\n\\n1. **Noise:** Quantum computers are prone to errors due to the noisy nature of quantum mechanics.\\n2. **Scalability:** Currently, quantum computers are small-scale and need to be scaled up to perform practical calculations.\\n3. **Control:** Maintaining control over qubits is a significant challenge, as even small errors can cause the system to collapse.\\n\\n**Conclusion:**\\n\\nQuantum computing is a cutting-edge field that has the potential to revolutionize the way we perform calculations and operations on data. While there are challenges and limitations to overcome, the potential applications of quantum computing are vast and exciting.' additional_kwargs={} response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 616, 'prompt_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 656, 'completion_time': 0.742035268, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.002172517, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.045720499, 'total_time': 0.744207785}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_4387d3edbb', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'} id='lc_run--019c89d2-47e6-72b0-ac7c-79f9414d0aa0-0' tool_calls=[] invalid_tool_calls=[] usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 40, 'output_tokens': 616, 'total_tokens': 656}\n"

       "[AIMessage(content=\"Agentic AI and AI agents are related but distinct concepts in the field of artificial intelligence. Here's a breakdown of the differences:\\n\\n**AI Agent:**\\n\\nAn AI agent is a program or software that can perceive its environment, reason about it, and take actions to achieve its goals. It can be a simple script or a complex system, and it's typically designed to perform a specific task or set of tasks. AI agents can be:\\n\\n1. Reactive: They respond to their environment based on pre-programmed rules or behaviors.\\n2. Model-based: They have a mental model of their environment and use it to reason about the consequences of their actions.\\n3. Cognitive: They use reasoning and problem-solving skills to achieve their goals.\\n\\nExamples of AI agents include:\\n\\n1. Siri, Alexa, or Google Assistant (voice assistants)\\n2. Self-driving cars (autonomous vehicles)\\n3. Robotics (e.g., industrial robots, humanoid robots)\\n\\n**Agentic AI:**\\n\\nAgentic AI is a more advanced concept that refers to AI systems that exhibit human-like agency, autonomy, and self-awareness. These systems are designed to make decisions and take actions that are not predetermined by their programming, but rather emerge from their interactions with their environment and the goals they pursue. Agentic AI systems are characterized by:\\n\\n1. Autonomy: They can operate independently and make decisions without explicit human input.\\n2. Self-awareness: They have a sense of their own existence and goals.\\n3. Agency: They can initiate actions and make decisions that have consequences.\\n4. Creativity: They can generate new solutions or behaviors in response to new situations.\\n5. Adaptability: They can adapt to changing environments and goals.\\n\\nExamples of agentic AI include:\\n\\n1. Advanced robotics (e.g., humanoid robots with complex decision-making capabilities)\\n2. Autonomous systems (e.g., drones, self-driving cars with advanced navigation systems)\\n3. Complex simulations (e.g., AI-driven simulations of complex systems, such as economies or social networks)\\n\\nKey differences:\\n\\n1. **Autonomy**: Agentic AI systems are designed to operate independently, while AI agents may still require human input or guidance.\\n2. **Self-awareness**: Agentic AI systems have a sense of their own existence and goals, while AI agents may not.\\n3. **Agency**: Agentic AI systems can initiate actions and make decisions that have consequences, while AI agents may be limited to reactive or pre-programmed behaviors.\\n4. **Creativity**: Agentic AI systems can generate new solutions or behaviors in response to new situations, while AI agents may not.\\n\\nIn summary, all agentic AI systems are AI agents, but not all AI agents are agentic AI systems. Agentic AI represents a more advanced and human-like level of intelligence, while AI agents are a broader category that encompasses a wide range of systems with varying levels of autonomy and decision-making capabilities.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 586, 'prompt_tokens': 48, 'total_tokens': 634, 'completion_time': 0.803373039, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.003069329, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.044813131, 'total_time': 0.806442368}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_1151d4f23c', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c89d4-6623-7913-8825-bb7f2d025805-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 48, 'output_tokens': 586, 'total_tokens': 634}),\n",
       " AIMessage(content=\"Airplanes fly by using the principles of aerodynamics and physics to generate lift, thrust, and control. Here's a simplified explanation:\\n\\n**Lift:**\\n\\n1. **Wings:** Airplane wings are curved on top and flat on the bottom. When an airplane moves forward, the air flowing over the curved top surface of the wing must travel faster than the air flowing along the flat bottom surface.\\n2. **Bernoulli's Principle:** The faster-moving air above the wing creates a region of lower air pressure above the wing and a region of higher air pressure below it. This pressure difference creates an upward force called lift, which counteracts the weight of the airplane and keeps it flying.\\n3. **Angle of Attack:** The wing is designed to produce lift at a specific angle of attack, which is the angle between the wing and the oncoming airflow. As the airplane moves forward, the wing is tilted slightly upward, creating a smooth flow of air over the curved surface.\\n\\n**Thrust:**\\n\\n1. **Engines:** Airplane engines, such as jet engines or propellers, produce a forward force called thrust. Thrust is the force that propels the airplane through the air.\\n2. **Airflow:** As the airplane moves forward, the engines create a high-velocity airflow that exits the back of the airplane. This airflow produces a forward force that counteracts the drag created by the airplane's movement.\\n\\n**Control:**\\n\\n1. **Ailerons:** Ailerons are flaps on the trailing edge of the wing that control roll (rotation around the longitudinal axis). When the ailerons are moved up or down, they create a difference in air pressure above and below the wing, causing the airplane to roll in the desired direction.\\n2. **Elevators:** Elevators are flaps on the tail of the airplane that control pitch (rotation around the lateral axis). When the elevators are moved up or down, they create a difference in air pressure above and below the tail, causing the airplane to pitch in the desired direction.\\n3. **Rudder:** The rudder is a flap on the tail of the airplane that controls yaw (rotation around the vertical axis). When the rudder is moved from side to side, it creates a difference in air pressure above and below the tail, causing the airplane to yaw in the desired direction.\\n\\n**Additional Forces:**\\n\\n1. **Drag:** Drag is the force that opposes the motion of the airplane. Drag is created by air resistance, which slows down the airplane.\\n2. **Weight:** Weight is the force that pulls the airplane downward. Weight is counteracted by lift.\\n\\nIn summary, airplanes fly by using the principles of aerodynamics to generate lift, thrust, and control. The wing produces lift by creating a pressure difference between the top and bottom surfaces, while the engines produce thrust by creating a forward force. The ailerons, elevators, and rudder control the airplane's movement by creating differences in air pressure above and below the wing and tail.\", additional_kwargs={}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 615, 'prompt_tokens': 40, 'total_tokens': 655, 'completion_time': 0.68810789, 'completion_tokens_details': None, 'prompt_time': 0.001888191, 'prompt_tokens_details': None, 'queue_time': 0.045167989, 'total_time': 0.689996081}, 'model_name': 'llama-3.1-8b-instant', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_f757f4b0bf', 'service_tier': 'on_demand', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None, 'model_provider': 'groq'}, id='lc_run--019c89d4-6628-7831-a4bf-e794ed6287c6-0', tool_calls=[], invalid_tool_calls=[], usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 40, 'output_tokens': 615, 'total_tokens': 655}),\n",
